# files that are not sent to build
# .dockerignore works only if it is placed in root folder of context of build (in our case the whole car-demo repo)
# remark: during github actions build, repo is checked out and node_modules, dist, ... folder are not present,
# so this setting is important if someone runs build on e.g. developer dir structure
